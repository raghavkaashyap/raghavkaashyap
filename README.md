## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a sophomore at Iowa State University majoring in Software Engineering, passionate about coding and exploring different technologies to build innovative solutions. Whether itâ€™s front-end, back-end, or full-stack development, I enjoy creating software that makes a difference. I'm currently working on a Utilities Spend Tracker application to streamline monthly expense management. I enjoy learning new things and continuously improving my skill set.
